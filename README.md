# AppiumScripts
Appium is used for Mobile Automation. 
I wrote scripts in Java and Python to start appium and run tpacketCapture application used to capture packets sent or received by an application installed. 
This was implemented to make dataset which I later used for my research.
test.py - code to automate installation, launching and uninstallation.
applicationInfo.sh - shell command to get package name
